# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Resource Management and Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Add resource management, monitoring, and backup capabilities to the system.
# Details:
Implement monitoring endpoints to track system resource usage. Add logging for critical operations and errors. Implement the backup strategy outlined in the PRD, including regular snapshots of user data directories and database backups. Create utilities for data replication across availability zones. Implement performance monitoring for LightRAG operations. Add configuration options for tuning LightRAG parameters like chunk sizes, embedding model parameters, and graph traversal depth.

# Test Strategy:
Test monitoring endpoints to ensure accurate resource reporting. Verify backup and restore functionality with sample data. Test performance under various load conditions. Verify logs contain appropriate information for debugging and auditing.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement System Monitoring and Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop and deploy monitoring endpoints to track system resource usage, and add comprehensive logging for critical operations and errors.
### Details:
Identify key system resources and operations to monitor (CPU, memory, disk, network, LightRAG performance metrics). Select or extend monitoring tools to expose these metrics via endpoints (e.g., REST, Prometheus). Integrate logging libraries to capture critical events and errors, ensuring logs are structured and accessible for troubleshooting. Define alerting thresholds and procedures for incident response. Validate monitoring and logging coverage through proof-of-concept testing and adjust based on feedback.[3][5]

## 2. Implement Backup and Data Replication Utilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Design and implement the backup strategy as outlined in the PRD, including regular snapshots of user data directories, database backups, and utilities for data replication across availability zones.
### Details:
Review the PRD to extract backup frequency, retention, and recovery requirements. Develop automated scripts or services to perform scheduled snapshots of user data and database backups. Implement utilities to replicate backups across multiple availability zones for redundancy. Ensure backup processes are logged and monitored, and test recovery procedures to verify data integrity and restore capabilities.

## 3. Add Configuration and Performance Tuning Options for LightRAG [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Expose configuration options for tuning LightRAG parameters (chunk sizes, embedding model parameters, graph traversal depth) and implement performance monitoring for LightRAG operations.
### Details:
Extend the system configuration interface (e.g., config files, environment variables, admin UI) to allow dynamic adjustment of LightRAG parameters. Integrate performance monitoring hooks specific to LightRAG operations, capturing metrics such as query latency, throughput, and resource consumption. Ensure changes to configuration are logged and can be rolled back if needed. Provide documentation and guidelines for tuning based on observed performance metrics.
