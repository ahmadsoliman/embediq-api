# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Document Management API Endpoints
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create API endpoints for document upload and management using LightRAG.
# Details:
Implement the /api/v1/documents endpoint with POST method for document uploads. Create a temporary file storage mechanism for handling uploaded files before processing with LightRAG. Use the user's LightRAG instance to process and store documents. Implement proper error handling and cleanup of temporary files. Add endpoints for listing, retrieving, and deleting documents. Ensure all operations use the user-specific LightRAG instance obtained through dependency injection.

# Test Strategy:
Test document upload with various file types and sizes. Verify documents are correctly processed by LightRAG and stored in user-specific directories. Test error handling for invalid files. Verify temporary files are properly cleaned up after processing. Test document listing and retrieval to ensure only the user's own documents are accessible.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Document Upload Endpoint with Temporary File Storage [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the /api/v1/documents POST endpoint to handle document uploads, storing files temporarily before processing with LightRAG.
### Details:
Develop the POST /api/v1/documents endpoint to accept file uploads. Implement a temporary file storage mechanism—such as saving files to a temp directory or using an in-memory store—ensuring files are accessible for subsequent processing. Integrate error handling for upload failures and ensure temporary files are cleaned up after processing or on error. Use dependency injection to access the user-specific LightRAG instance for later processing steps.

## 2. Integrate LightRAG Processing and Persistent Document Storage [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Process uploaded documents using the user-specific LightRAG instance and store processed documents persistently.
### Details:
After successful upload and temporary storage, invoke the LightRAG instance (retrieved via dependency injection) to process the uploaded document. Store the processed document and its metadata in a persistent storage solution (e.g., database or object storage). Ensure that temporary files are deleted after processing, and implement robust error handling to manage failures during processing or storage.

## 3. Implement Document Listing, Retrieval, and Deletion Endpoints [done]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Create endpoints for listing all documents, retrieving a specific document, and deleting documents, ensuring all operations use the user-specific LightRAG instance.
### Details:
Develop GET /api/v1/documents for listing documents, GET /api/v1/documents/{id} for retrieving a specific document, and DELETE /api/v1/documents/{id} for deleting documents. Ensure each endpoint interacts with the persistent storage and uses the user-specific LightRAG instance for any required document operations. Implement proper error handling and return appropriate HTTP status codes for all operations.
