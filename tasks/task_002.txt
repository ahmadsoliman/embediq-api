# Task ID: 2
# Title: Create Backend Dockerfile and Project Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the backend project structure and create a Dockerfile for containerization.
# Details:
Create a Dockerfile in the backend directory using python:3.10-slim as the base image. Set up the project structure with appropriate directories for routes, middleware, services, and utilities. Initialize a Python FastAPI project with requirements.txt including FastAPI, uvicorn, python-jose for JWT handling, httpx for HTTP requests, and any other required dependencies. Create the main application entry point that initializes FastAPI. Set up health check endpoint for container monitoring.

# Test Strategy:
Build the Docker image and verify it runs successfully. Test the health check endpoint. Ensure the project structure follows best practices and all dependencies are correctly specified in requirements.txt.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Backend Project Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the backend directory with a clear and scalable FastAPI project structure, including subdirectories for routes, middleware, services, and utilities.
### Details:
Create the backend root directory. Inside, add subdirectories: routes (for API endpoints), middleware (for custom middleware), services (for business logic), and utilities (for helper functions). Add an __init__.py file in each directory to make them Python packages. Create a main.py file at the root as the application entry point. Follow best practices for modular FastAPI applications[2][5].

## 2. Initialize FastAPI Application and Health Check Endpoint [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Set up the FastAPI application in main.py, configure the app to include a health check endpoint, and prepare requirements.txt with all necessary dependencies.
### Details:
In main.py, initialize a FastAPI app instance. Implement a basic health check endpoint (e.g., /health) that returns a simple JSON response for container monitoring. Create a requirements.txt file listing FastAPI, uvicorn, python-jose, httpx, and any other required packages. Ensure the app imports and registers routes, middleware, and other components as needed[2][5].

## 3. Create Dockerfile for Backend Containerization [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Write a Dockerfile in the backend directory to containerize the FastAPI application using python:3.10-slim as the base image.
### Details:
In the backend directory, create a Dockerfile that uses python:3.10-slim as the base image. Set the working directory, copy project files, install dependencies from requirements.txt, expose the appropriate port (e.g., 80), and define the CMD to start the FastAPI app with uvicorn. Ensure the Dockerfile follows best practices for Python and FastAPI containerization[1][3][4].
