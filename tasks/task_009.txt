# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Data Source Configuration API
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: low
# Description: Create API endpoints for configuring external data sources.
# Details:
Implement the /api/v1/datasources endpoint for configuring external data sources. Create methods for adding, updating, and removing data source configurations. Define request and response models for data source operations. Ensure configurations are stored in the user's working directory. Implement validation for different data source types.

# Test Strategy:
Test data source configuration endpoints with various input parameters. Verify configurations are correctly stored in user-specific directories. Test validation of different data source types. Verify configurations persist across application restarts.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design API Endpoints and Data Models [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the /api/v1/datasources endpoint structure and specify request and response models for adding, updating, and removing data source configurations.
### Details:
Determine the HTTP methods (POST for add, PUT/PATCH for update, DELETE for remove) and the required parameters for each operation. Design JSON schemas for request and response payloads, ensuring they capture all necessary fields for different data source types. Document the endpoint contracts clearly for implementation and future reference.

## 2. Implement Endpoint Logic and Configuration Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Develop the backend logic for the /api/v1/datasources endpoint, handling add, update, and remove operations, and persist configurations in the user's working directory.
### Details:
Set up route handlers in the chosen backend framework to process incoming requests according to the defined models. Implement logic to read from and write to configuration files (e.g., JSON or YAML) stored in the user's working directory. Ensure thread-safe and consistent updates to the configuration storage.

## 3. Add Data Source Type Validation and Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Implement validation logic for different data source types and robust error handling for all endpoint operations.
### Details:
For each supported data source type, define validation rules (e.g., required fields, format checks, connection tests). Integrate validation into the endpoint handlers so that invalid configurations are rejected with clear error messages. Ensure all errors (validation, storage, unexpected) are handled gracefully and returned in a consistent response format.
